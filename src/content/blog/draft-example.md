## This is a Draft

This blog post is marked as a draft, which means:

- It won't appear in the blog index page
- It won't be included in the RSS feed
- It can still be accessed directly via URL: `/blog/draft-example`
- It can be committed to version control
- When ready to publish, just change `draft: true` to `draft: false` or remove the draft field entirely

This is perfect for:
- Work-in-progress posts
- Posts scheduled for future publication
- Content that needs review before going live
