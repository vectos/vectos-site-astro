At Vandebron, I contributed to the transition towards a sustainable energy system by building reliable, high-performance software. My work spanned billing automation, testing infrastructure, asset control, and core system migrationsâ€”impacting critical operations across energy generation, distribution, and trading. These efforts helped reduce manual overhead, improve system resilience, and unlock smarter control over renewable assets like wind and solar.
