      A decentralized brain that lives where your plants do.
      Instead of relying entirely on the cloud, Mycelium uses an edge-focused architecture. A central edge device (edge-central) collects sensor data, schedules watering events, and only syncs with the backend when necessaryâ€”saving bandwidth and increasing privacy and responsiveness.

      - The edge-central device continuously scans for nearby sensors
      - Secure command scheduling and time synchronization using gRPC + JWT
      - Resilient offline-first behavior with seamless cloud integration

      Stay in touch with your plantsâ€”from anywhere.
      The Mycelium app puts all your plant data in your hands. Whether youâ€™re naming your fern or adjusting watering schedules, the app speaks to the backend (and indirectly to your garden), making plant care smart and personal.

      - Cross-platform app (mobile & desktop) with real-time updates
      - Onboarding and device setup via BLE and Auth0-secured login
      - View historical measurements, tweak watering behavior, and get smart insights

Mycelium brings intelligent plant care into homes and gardens by seamlessly combining smart electronics with intuitive design. At the heart of the system are custom sensors and water controllersâ€”small, low-energy devices that monitor your plants' moisture levels and water them when needed. Itâ€™s hands-off help for healthy, thriving greenery.

- Custom low-power sensors (edge-peripheral) keep watch on soil and environmental conditions
- BLE ensures ultra-efficient communication with minimal battery usage
- Designed for both indoor pots and outdoor gardens
